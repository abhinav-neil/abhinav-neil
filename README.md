### Hi there 👋

I'm Neil, a self-taught programmer and AI enthusiast. Highly proficient in Python and its ML/DL ecosystem, I'm deeply passionate about the AI revolution! ❤️ My particular interests lie in NLP & LLMs, and I'm always keen on applying AI to solve real-world challenges. 😄 Currently, I'm completing my Master's in AI at the University of Amsterdam and am eager to bring my technical skills and knowledge to the industry! ✊

In my free time, I enjoy staying active 🏋️‍♂️, playing football ⚽, and strumming the guitar (acoustic fingerstyle) 🎸.

Got an intriguing project idea or questions about my work? Don't hesitate to reach out! I'm all for connecting and collaborating. 😃
