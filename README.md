### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abhinav. Self-taught programmer and AI nerd. I'm very enthusiastic about the AI revolution! :heart: I love NLP & deep learning, and I'm also interested in other fields of AI like causality and reinforcement learning. I like coding ML models & neural nets. :smile:

I'm currently pursuing my master's in AI @ the University of Amsterdam. I hope to learn a lot more about the field, and prepare myself for an exciting career in this dynamic field. :fist:

A few other hobbies: guitar :guitar: (acoustic fingerstyle) and reading :books: (both fiction & non-fiction)

If you have any interesting project ideas, or questions about any of my projects, feel free to hit me up! I'd love to connect & colab. :grinning:
